# Darren's todo list for road to Games Fleadh:)

1. Create a rotation reflection.
2. Implement collision for all the barriers.
3. Make a preview video.
4. Create a class for player input which abstracts a up movment,
	down movement etc so i don't have to check for keyboard,
	controller, sterring wheel etc.
5. Create create account in menu.
6. Will need to look over menu memory cost. Need to refactor code because
	it is a bit messey and the rendering is all over the place.
