# Fusion Rush
Fusion Rush is a survival racing game with an aesthetic throw back to old acrade games displayed on CRT displays.

A work in progress racing game for GamesFleadh 2017. The theme of GamesFleadh 2017 is "Racing Game" and will be held on March the 8th. I will be uploading a build instructions after this date along with some extra code refactor.
